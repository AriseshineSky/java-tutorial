## Assignments of Chapter 2

### Required
* Given an integer array, output the maximum and minimum number.
You are not allowed to sort the array using existing API
* Given an integer array, output the first maximum and second maximum number.
You are not allowed to sort the array using existing API
* Given an integer array, count the unique combinations of three numbers such that sum of them is 0.
For example, if we have [-1, -2, 3, -4, -5, 9, 10, 11], the expected count should be 2, which
are `-1, -2, 3` and `-4, -5, 9`. You can assume there is no duplicated element in the array

### Optional
* Given an integer array, output the first maximum, second maximum, and third maximum number.
You are not allowed to sort the array using existing API
* Given an float array, double array and date array, can you reuse the code you've written already?
Or you just copy & paste first, then made slight changes?
* Using [1000000 integers](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/14analysis/1Mints.txt) as input, how would
you optimize you solution of the 3rd required problem?
* If you have optimized the 3rd required problem successfully, how about if there are duplicated
integers in the array? For example, [-1, -1, -2, -2, 3, -4, -5, 9, 10, 11], the expected result
should be still 2, you cannot count [-1, -2, 3] and [-1, -2, 3] twice as there is only one 3

### Tips
You may use [NumberGame.java](./src/main/java/NumberGame.java) as a start and fill in the codes that
would work. You can change method signature freely, which means you can change return type, argument types
freely if needed.
