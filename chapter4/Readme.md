### Attention, attention, please
* From Chapter 4 on, solutions will be developed and tested under JDK11
* Please set Working Directory as `$MODULE_DIR$` because this is a multi-module project
* You can add VM options `-splash:images/champions.jpg` to enable splash feature
* You can add argument `Start` to skip home team, visiting team and stadium selection and apply
default settings directly
* You may be disappointed that No AI here - something you never expect to learn from this course
* Players, referees and audience employ simply random selection strategy to determine their behavior
* No fancy GUI stuff here, just use simple Graphics API to draw or fill rectangle, arc and etc

And keep coding, to understand or reject those buzz words of OOP
