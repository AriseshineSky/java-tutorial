### Run at Terminal
```cmd
:: under java-tutorial root directory
mvn clean package
cd chapter4
:: make sure JDK11 is before JDK8 if they were all in path
set PATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.2\bin;%PATH%;
:: for linux, replace ';' with ':'
java -cp "target/deps/*;target/classes/" Game
```

### Attention, attention, please
* From Chapter 4 on, solutions will be developed and tested under JDK11
* Please set Working Directory as `$MODULE_DIR$` because this is a multi-module project
* You can add VM options `-splash:images/champions.jpg` to enable splash feature
* You can add argument `Start` to skip home team, visiting team and stadium selection and apply
default settings directly
* You may be disappointed that No AI here - something you never expect to learn from this course
* Players, referees and audience employ simply random selection strategy to determine their behavior
* No fancy GUI stuff here, just use simple Graphics API to draw or fill rectangle, arc and etc
