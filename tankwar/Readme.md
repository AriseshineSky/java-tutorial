## Introduction

This is a simple Tank War game based on Java Swing. I first got to know this project at 2009 in
a coding camp located in Beijing. It's a good example for beginners to learn OOP thus I put it
here. Certain adjustments were made against the previous code so that it would be up to date relatively.

Minimum audio effects of shoot and explosion were also added, as for background music, it would be
a good option to get from [World of Tanks](https://worldoftanks.com/en/content/music/).
