## Introduction

This is a simple Tank War game based on Java Swing. I first got to know this project at 2009 in
a coding camp located in Beijing. It's a good example for beginners to learn OOP thus I put it
here. Certain adjustments were made against the previous code so that it would be up to date relatively.
